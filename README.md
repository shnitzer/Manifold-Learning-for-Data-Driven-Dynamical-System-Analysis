# Manifold-Learning-for-Data-Driven-Dynamical-System-Analysis
MATLAB code implementation of the non-Linear object tracking example  from: 
T. Shnitzer, R. Talmon and J.J. Slotine, "Manifold Learning for Data-Driven Dynamical System Analysis"

To Create RMSE plots of the diffusion maps kalman filter, diffusion maps based observer framework and optimal particle filter run:
>>main.m

To Create Figure 5 and Figure 3 from the book chapter run: 
>> fig5.m
