# Diffusion-Maps-Kalman
MATLAB code implementation of the non-Linear object tracking example  from: 
T. Shnitzer, R. Talmon and J.J. Slotine, "Manifold Learning for Data-Driven Dynamical System Analysis"

To Create RMSE plots of the diffusion maps kalman filter, diffusion maps based observer framework and optimal particle filter:
Execute: >> main.m

To Create Figure 5 and Figure 3 from the book chapter:
Execute: >> fig5.m
